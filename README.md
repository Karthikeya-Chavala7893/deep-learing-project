## 🎯 Project Objective

### The Problem We're Solving

> **Millions of people worldwide lose their eyesight every year from diseases that are completely preventable — if caught early enough.**

Consider these alarming statistics:

| Statistic | Impact |
|:---|:---|
| 🌍 **463 million** people worldwide have diabetes | Each one is at risk for diabetic retinopathy |
| 👁️ **1 in 3** diabetics develop retinopathy | That's ~154 million people |
| ⏰ **95%** of vision loss is preventable | But only with **early detection** |
| 🏥 Specialist eye exams cost **$200–$500** | Unaffordable for most of the developing world |
| 🕐 Wait times for specialists can be **months** | Disease progresses silently while waiting |

**The core problem:** Eye diseases like Glaucoma, AMD, and Diabetic Retinopathy are called **"silent thieves of sight"** because:
- They show **zero symptoms** in early stages
- By the time a patient notices blurry vision, **permanent damage** has already occurred
- Specialist screenings are **expensive and inaccessible** in rural/low-income areas
- There are **not enough ophthalmologists** to screen everyone who needs it

---

## 🔬 Diseases Detected by VisionAI

Our AI model (`NeuronZero/EyeDiseaseClassifier`) is trained to recognize **10+ conditions** across multiple categories:

### 🩸 Diabetic Retinopathy (5 Severity Levels)

Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is the #1 cause of preventable blindness in working-age adults. VisionAI classifies DR into 5 progressive stages:

| Stage | Severity | What the AI Looks For | What It Means for the Patient |
|:---|:---:|:---|:---|
| **No DR** | ✅ Healthy | Clear vasculature, healthy optic disc | Great news — continue annual checkups |
| **Mild DR** | ⚠️ Warning | Microaneurysms (tiny bulges in blood vessels) | Early stage — see doctor within 3 months |
| **Moderate DR** | 🔴 Danger | Multiple hemorrhages, cotton wool spots | Blood vessel damage — specialist within 2-4 weeks |
| **Severe DR** | 🚨 Critical | Extensive hemorrhages, venous beading, IRMA | Significant damage — specialist within days |
| **Proliferative DR** | 🆘 Emergency | Neovascularization (abnormal vessel growth) | Fragile vessels can bleed/detach — URGENT treatment |

### 👁️ Other Eye Diseases

| Disease | Icon | What It Is (Simple Explanation) | What the AI Detects |
|:---|:---:|:---|:---|
| **Glaucoma** | ⚠️ | Pressure builds up inside your eye and slowly crushes the optic nerve — like a closing tunnel | Optic disc cupping, nerve fiber thinning |
| **AMD (Age-Related Macular Degeneration)** | 🔴 | The center of your retina wears out, making everything blurry in the middle | Drusen deposits, pigmentary changes |
| **Cataract** | 🌫️ | The clear lens inside your eye turns cloudy — like looking through a foggy window | Lens opacity, clouded fundus reflection |
| **Hypertensive Retinopathy** | 🩸 | High blood pressure damages the tiny blood vessels in your eye | Arteriovenous nicking, flame hemorrhages |
| **Diabetic Eye Signs** | 🩺 | Early diabetes damage to retinal blood vessels | Retinal vessel changes, early leakage signs |
| **Other / Unclassified** | 🔍 | Something unusual that needs professional review | Atypical retinal features |
| **Healthy Retina** | ✅ | No disease detected — your eyes look great! | Normal vasculature, clear optic disc |

## 📄 File-by-File Deep Dive

### 1. `app.py` — The Backend Brain (320 lines)

> **This is the most important file.** It's the Flask server that handles everything: authentication, AI inference, database operations, and API routing.

| Section (Lines) | What It Does | Key Concepts for Beginners |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Configuration** (L24–L34) | Defines all app settings: secret key, model ID, upload folder, file size limits, OAuth credentials, Supabase URL | Environment variables via `os.environ.get()` with fallback defaults |
| **App Initialization** (L38–L64) | Creates Flask app, sets up CORS, Flask-Login, OAuth, and Supabase client | `Flask(__name__)` creates the app; `CORS(app)` allows cross-origin requests |
| **AI Model Loading** (L69–L79) | Downloads and loads the EfficientNetB0 model from Hugging Face on startup | `AutoModelForImageClassification` auto-downloads the model weights |
| **User Model** (L83–L106) | `User` class extending `UserMixin` — holds user data (id, email, name, password hash) | Object-Oriented Programming — the class represents a user entity |
| **Database Functions** (L108–L134) | CRUD operations: `save_user_to_db()`, `get_user_by_id()`, `get_user_by_email()` | Supabase Python SDK: `supabase.table('users').select('*').eq('id', id)` |
| **Auth Routes** (L139–L230) | Login, register, Google OAuth, logout, auth status | `@login_required` decorator protects routes; `login_user()` creates sessions |
| **Main Routes** (L234–L298) | Home page, screening page, `/predict` endpoint, health check, config | `/predict` is the core endpoint — receives image, runs AI, returns JSON |
| **Error Handlers** (L302–L314) | Custom 401, 404, 500 error pages | Returns JSON for API requests, redirects for browser requests |

#### 🔑 Key Function: `/predict` Route (The AI Pipeline)

```python
# Simplified version of what happens when you upload an image:

@app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])
@login_required                              # 1. Must be logged in
def predict():
    file = request.files['image']            # 2. Get uploaded file
    file.save(saved_path)                    # 3. Save temporarily
    
    image = Image.open(saved_path).convert('RGB')     # 4. Open with PIL
    inputs = image_processor(images=image, ...)       # 5. Normalize to 224x224 tensor
    outputs = eye_model(**inputs)                      # 6. Run through EfficientNet
    probs = torch.softmax(outputs.logits, dim=-1)     # 7. Get probability scores
    
    os.remove(saved_path)                    # 8. DELETE image immediately
    return jsonify({'predictions': [...]})   # 9. Return results as JSON
```

## ⚙️ How the AI Model Works

### The Model: EfficientNetB0

VisionAI uses the **`NeuronZero/EyeDiseaseClassifier`** model from Hugging Face, which is an **EfficientNetB0** architecture fine-tuned for retinal disease classification.

```
What is EfficientNetB0?
├── It's a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
├── Developed by Google Research
├── "Efficient" = high accuracy with fewer parameters
├── ~5.3 million parameters (compact enough to run on CPU)
└── Pre-trained on ImageNet, fine-tuned on retinal images
```

### Key Code (Simplified)

```python
# 1. Load model once at startup (app.py lines 70-79)
image_processor = AutoImageProcessor.from_pretrained('NeuronZero/EyeDiseaseClassifier')
eye_model = AutoModelForImageClassification.from_pretrained('NeuronZero/EyeDiseaseClassifier')
eye_model.eval()  # Set to evaluation mode (no gradient tracking)

# 2. For each prediction request (app.py lines 260-278)
image = Image.open(saved_path).convert('RGB')     # Open as RGB
inputs = image_processor(images=image, return_tensors='pt')  # Normalize + tensor
with torch.no_grad():                              # No gradient computation needed
    outputs = eye_model(**inputs)                   # Forward pass
probs = torch.softmax(outputs.logits, dim=-1)[0]   # Get probabilities
```

## 🔐 Authentication System

VisionAI supports **two authentication methods**:

### Method 1: Email + Password

```
User fills form → POST /auth/register or /auth/login → 
Werkzeug hashes password → Supabase stores user → Flask-Login creates session
```

| Step | Detail |
|:---|:---|
| Password Hashing | `generate_password_hash()` from Werkzeug (bcrypt-based) |
| Password Verification | `check_password_hash()` compares against stored hash |
| Session Management | Flask-Login stores session cookie in browser |
| Minimum Password | 8 characters enforced both client-side and server-side |

### Method 2: Google OAuth 2.0

```
User clicks "Continue with Google" → /auth/google → 
Google consent screen → /auth/google/callback → 
Google returns user info → Supabase stores/retrieves user → Flask-Login creates session
```

| Step | Detail |
|:---|:---|
| OAuth Library | Authlib's Flask integration |
| Flow | OpenID Connect (OIDC) via Google's `.well-known/openid-configuration` |
| Data Retrieved | Email, name, profile picture URL |
| Auto-Registration | If Google email not found, automatically creates new account |

### Supabase Database Schema

The `users` table in Supabase stores:

| Column | Type | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `id` | text | Unique ID (e.g., `user_1`, `google_1`) |
| `email` | text | User's email address |
| `name` | text | Full name |
| `phone` | text | Phone number (optional) |
| `password_hash` | text | Werkzeug hashed password (null for Google users) |
| `login_method` | text | `Password` or `Google` |
| `role` | text | `patient` (default) |
| `is_active` | boolean | Account active status |
| `last_login` | timestamp | Last login datetime |
| `created_at` | timestamp | Account creation datetime |

## 📊 PDF Report Generation

VisionAI generates **professional, branded medical reports** entirely client-side using **jsPDF**.

### What's in the Report?

| Section | Contents |
|:---|:---|
| **Header** | VisionAI branding, date, time, unique report ID |
| **Primary Finding** | Disease name, severity badge, match score, description |
| **Analysis Table** | All detected conditions with progress bars and percentages |
| **Detailed Analysis** | Medical description of the primary finding |
| **Recommendations** | Numbered action items with priority levels |
| **Daily Habits** | Lifestyle changes with frequency suggestions |
| **Prevention Tips** | Long-term prevention strategies |
| **Medical Disclaimer** | Legal disclaimer about AI limitations |
| **Footer** | "Powered by VisionAI" + page numbers on every page |

### Why Client-Side PDF?

> **Privacy by design.** The PDF is generated entirely in the user's browser using JavaScript (jsPDF). No medical data is ever sent to any server for report generation. This ensures zero data leaks of sensitive medical results.

## 🚀 Getting Started (Setup Guide)

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.9+** installed on your system
- **~2GB disk space** (for PyTorch and the AI model)
- A **Supabase** account (free tier works)
- (Optional) A **Google Cloud** project for OAuth

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Karthikeya-Chavala7893/deep-learing-project.git
cd deep-learing-project
```

### Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment

A virtual environment keeps your project's packages isolated from your system Python.

```bash
# Create the virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate it (Windows — PowerShell)
venv\Scripts\activate

# Activate it (Windows — Command Prompt)
venv\Scripts\activate.bat

# Activate it (Mac/Linux)
source venv/bin/activate
```

> 💡 **You'll know it's activated** when you see `(venv)` at the beginning of your terminal prompt.

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> ⏱️ **This will take 5-10 minutes** the first time as it downloads PyTorch (~800MB) and other packages.

### Step 4: Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
# Supabase (Required — get these from supabase.com)
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
SUPABASE_KEY=your-anon-public-key

# Flask Secret Key (generates automatically if not set)
SECRET_KEY=your-random-secret-key

# Google OAuth (Optional — for Google Sign-In)
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-client-secret
```

#### How to Get Supabase Keys:

1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) → Create a free project
2. Go to **Settings** → **API**
3. Copy the **Project URL** and **anon/public key**
4. Create a `users` table with the columns listed in the [Database Schema](#supabase-database-schema) section

#### How to Get Google OAuth Keys (Optional):

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project → Enable **Google+ API**
3. Go to **Credentials** → Create **OAuth Client ID**
4. Set authorized redirect URI to: `http://localhost:5000/auth/google/callback`
5. Copy the Client ID and Client Secret

### Step 5: Launch the Server

```bash
python app.py
```

You should see output like:

```
✅ Supabase client initialized: https://xxx.supabase.co
🧠 Loading AI model: NeuronZero/EyeDiseaseClassifier
✅ AI model loaded! Classes: ['No_DR', 'Mild', 'Moderate', 'Severe', ...]
 * Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000
```

### Step 6: Open in Browser

Navigate to **[http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)** — you're ready to screen! 🎉
